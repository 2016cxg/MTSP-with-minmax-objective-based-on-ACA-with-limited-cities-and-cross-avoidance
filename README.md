# MTSP-with-minmax-objective-based-on-ACA-with-limited-cities-and-cross-avoidance

# Description
This a graduation project in Chongqing University. In this project, I researched how to adjust ant colony optimization to handle
MTSP and used cross avoidence to optimize the solution. Then, I generated some problems by eil51 and used the algorithm to deal
with the problems. Comparing those results with Lingo ones, this implementation shows a good performance.
